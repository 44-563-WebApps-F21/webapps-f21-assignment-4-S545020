        _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.
        <br>
        <br>      
        [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
_He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
_As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]
    </h5>
    
       <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6> <br><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions"> [_With great deliberation_.]</p> <p class="speech"> A thoroughly shallow creed.</p>

        <h6 class=" name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br> <p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions">[_Rising_.] </p><p class="speech">I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think
        so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very
        outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never
        been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what
        a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.</p>
        
       <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5"> LORD GORING.</h6><br><p class="speech">Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  But
        tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do
        what you did?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br><p class="speech"> When I was going away he said to me that if I ever
        could give him any private information of real value he would make me a
        very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
        ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks
        later certain private documents passed through my hands.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING</h6><br><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions"> [_Keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet_.] </p><p class="speech"> State
        documents?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br><p class="speech"> Yes. </p><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions"> [LORD GORING _sighs_, _then passes his hand
        across his forehead and looks up_.]</p><br>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6><br>p class="speech">I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
        been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim
        held out to you.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br>  <p>Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick
        of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is
        weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible
        temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.
        To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
        throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no
        weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that
        courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the
        letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over
        the transaction.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING. </h6><br><p class="speech"> And you?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br> <p class="speech"> I received from the Baron £110,000.</p> 
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6><br><p class="speech">  You were worth more, Robert.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br>  <p class="speech">No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power
        over others.  I went into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in
        finance from time to time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my
        fortune.  Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a
        success.  In all things connected with money I have had a luck so
        extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  I remember
        having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to
        punish us they answer our prayers.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6><br><p class="speech" > But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for
        what you had done?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br><p class="speech"> No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its
        own weapons, and won.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6><br><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions">  [_Sadly_.] </p><p class="speech"> You thought you had won.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name sirrobertchiltern fas fa-user h5">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6><br><p class="speech">  I thought so.</p><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions"> [_After a long pause_.] </p> <p class="speech"> Arthur, do
        you despise me for what I have told you?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name lord fas fa-user h5">LORD GORING.</h6><br><p class="stage_directions hover fas fa-directions">  [_With deep feeling in his voice_.] </p><p class="speech"> I am very sorry for
        you, Robert, very sorry indeed.</p>
